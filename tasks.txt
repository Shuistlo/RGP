SEMESTER 1:
Shu - Hardware Design + Obstacle Avoidance 
Ashley - Hardware Design + Color sensor orientation
Eric - Color Sensor orientation + Obstacle Avoidance
Andrei - PID line following + code integration

SEMESTER 1 GOALS:
Design a mobile, compact robot
Experiment with sensors and determine which ones we need
Code a PID line following controller 
Code a PD obstacle avoidance controller
Tune both controllers optimally 
Enable the colorsensor to be able to read a red line to stop its motion
End result: Robot should be able to successfully complete 4 laps in 5 minutes

WEEK 1 : Group formation and Hardware Design. Since we didn't have a clear idea of the robot worked and which sensors we needed this took some time
WEEK 2 : Hardware Design
WEEK 3 : Color Sensor testing and Orientation
WEEK 4 : Some Hardware re-design to accomadate for the color sensor. Pseudocode for color sensor written
WEEK 5 : PID Line following Pseudocode written. Hardware design reworked to include an ultrasonic sensor for PD obstacle avoidance
WEEK 6 : PID Line following code imlemented with color sensor code.  PD Obstacle Avoidance Pseudocode written
WEEK 7 : PID Line following tuning. PD obstacle avoidance code written
WEEK 8 : PID Line following tuning 
WEEK 9 : Code Integration and tuning
WEEK 10 : Final tuning and Grading

SEMESTER 2:
Shu - Hardware Design + Path Planning
Ashley - Hardware Design + Path Planning
Eric - Localization + Differential Drive
Andrei - Map + Differential Drive

SEMESTER 2 GOALS:
Design a mobile, compact robot
Experiment with the gyrosensor (unused in first task)
Create a map of the arena 
Translate the map into a readable format for the robot
Create an A* algorithm the robot can use to plan a path in the arena
Localization
Differential Drive
End Result: Robot should be able to successfully navigate the arena from the starting point to the goal and back twice in 5 minutes

WEEK 1 : Hardware Design and Task Allocation
WEEK 2 : Hardware Design. Initial Gyrosensor related tasks Pseudocode written
WEEK 3 : Gyrosensor alignment tasks done and recorded
WEEK 4 : Board dimensions measured and Map dimensions planned
WEEK 5 : Map Code finished
WEEK 6 : Localization  and Path Planning pseudocode written
WEEK 7 : Pseudocode for Path Planning rewritten. Some Back end code for Path planning written
WEEK 8 : Path Planning finished
WEEK 9 : Localization + Differential Drive Code written
WEEK 10 : Grading
